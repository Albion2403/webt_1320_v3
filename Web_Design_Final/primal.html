            <img src="images/GreatApe.jpg" alt="Oozaru">
               <p>The Great Ape form in Dragon Ball is a transformation that Saiyan characters can undergo when they look at a full moon. When a Saiyan with a tail sees the moon, they 
                transform into a gigantic, uncontrollable, and highly powerful ape-like creature known as a Great Ape, or Oozaru in Japanese. In this form, their physical strength and 
                abilities are greatly enhanced, but they lose all self-control and typically become a destructive force until the moon is obscured or they are subdued.</p>
            <img src="images/GoldenGreatApe.jpg" alt="GoldenOozaru">
   
               <p>The Golden Great Ape is a powerful transformation seen in Dragon Ball GT. It occurs when a Saiyan with a tail transforms into a Great Ape and then, under certain conditions, 
                gains control over this form. In this state, the Saiyan retains their rationality but becomes a massive, golden-furred ape with increased strength and energy projection capabilities, 
                making it a formidable and unique transformation in the Dragon Ball series.</p>
            <img src="images/SSJ4vegito.jpg" alt="SuperSaiyan4">
                
                <p>Super Saiyan 4 is a powerful transformation in the Dragon Ball GT series, marking a departure from the Super Saiyan forms introduced in Dragon Ball Z. To achieve this form, a 
                Saiyan must first become a Golden Great Ape and then regain control of their actions and emotions. In this state, they manifest a humanoid appearance with long, dark fur, red eyes, 
                and a significant power boost, combining the strength of their Great Ape form with the strategic thinking of their base Saiyan form. This transformation is distinctive for its unique 
                design and is considered one of the most iconic transformations in the Dragon Ball franchise.</p>

                <p>In this form, the Super Saiyan 4's body is filled to the brim with ki. The normally reddish fur takes on a magenta hue, and the hair turns crimson red with dark shadows, similar in 
                appearance to that of Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta. The user gains a flowing purple aura similar to that of Perfected Ultra Instinct, and a skin-tight white aura when the primary aura is dissipated.
                Even compared to the normal Super Saiyan 4 form, the voice of the user becomes deeper and calmer. Unique to Xeno Gogeta, the hair lengthens further and takes on an appearance close to that
                of Super Saiyan 3.</p>
