    <h2>Welcome to My Website</h2>
    <p> Alcohol Markers are a special kind of marker made to be an artist grade supply. Alcohol markers use alcohol ink and are usually doubled ended
        ended featuring either a paring of a bullet chsiel nib or brush and chisel nib. In rare cases certain brands will have a brush and bullet nib.
        These markers are made with the purpose of being able to blend and layer without destroying the surface of the paper and to be able to achieve
        the desired gradients and shading of an artist's artwork. These markers are capable of great art when used correctly. They are among the elite of physical
        art media supplies do to their high skill ceiling, but while being user-friendly, and blending capabiltiy. Alcohol markers also usually have ranges of 
        color from 100 to 300 different colors.</p>

    <p> These markers sound amazing but they are expensive. Alcohol markers are a lot more expensive than water-based markers because of their artist-grade quality.
        Many different brands make these markers with some of the most popular being Copic, Arteza, Winsor&Newton and Ohuhu. Copic is very expensive but its considered
        to be the "standard" among brands of alcohol markers. Copic is an investment as once you get the markers you can refill them with the cheaper to purchase ink refills
        for the markers. Ohuhu, Arteza, and Winsor&Newton sell individual markers so you can buy one marker instead of another set. Ohuhu is the cheapest marker but rivals 
        Copic the most in terms of qualities while even surpassing them in some areas. Ohuhu has become one of the most popular brands of alcohol markers for its quality and
        affordablity. Alcohol markers are a top of the line art supplies with many different brands to choose. </p>
