        <h3>More about the Mons</h3>
        <p>Pokémon, short for "Pocket Monsters," are fictional creatures that inhabit the world of the Pokémon franchise. 
            In the Pokémon universe, humans known as Pokémon Trainers capture, train, and build relationships with these creatures. 
            Trainers use Poké Balls, specialized devices, to capture wild Pokémon, and then raise and train them to become companions 
            and battle partners. The goal is to become a skilled Trainer, often aiming to become a Pokémon Champion by competing in 
            various Pokémon Leagues and tournaments.Pokémon are typically categorized into different types, such as Fire, Water, 
            Grass, Electric, Psychic, and many more. Each type has strengths and weaknesses against other types, creating a strategic 
            layer in battles. For instance, Water-type Pokémon are strong against Fire-types but weak against Electric-types. As players
            engage with Pokémon, they can help their creatures level up, learn new moves, and sometimes undergo transformations called 
            "evolutions," where a Pokémon evolves into a more advanced form. The franchise often introduces new generations of Pokémon 
            with each iteration, bringing in new species with unique designs, abilities, and lore, further expanding the rich and diverse 
            world of Pokémon.</p>
